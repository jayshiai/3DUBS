const description = "Hey there! I'm all about the simple joys inspired by pandasâ€”eating, sleeping, a bit of work, and then doing it all over again. I love exploring the colorful world around us and playing with different shades of universe. Designing and bringing ideas to life in web development is my jam. Plus, I'm a tech enthusiast with a decent grasp of C, C++, and some Java and Python basics. When I'm not immersed in coding, you'll probably find me curled up enjoying a nature walk or sleeping . Let's keep it fun, keep learning, and embrace the beauty of simplicity!"
